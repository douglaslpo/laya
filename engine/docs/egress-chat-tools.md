# Egress Chat Tools

> Detailed design for chat-driven egress — LLM tool definitions, interaction patterns,
> and the preview/confirm flow.
> Part of the [Egress Architecture](egress-architecture.md).

---

## 1. Overview

Every egress capability is exposed as an LLM tool in the chat pipeline. This makes
chat a **first-class control surface** — users can trigger any platform action by
describing it in natural language.

The tools are added to `get_all_tool_definitions()` and executed by the existing chat
tool loop in `pipeline/chat.py`.

### Design Goals

- **Natural language**: "Approve PR 23" should just work.
- **Smart resolution**: Fuzzy match ticket/PR identifiers, suggest corrections for typos.
- **Preview before execute**: User always sees what will happen before confirming.
- **Compose bridge**: "Reply to Sarah's email" opens the compose editor, not sends directly.
- **Cross-platform**: "Close the Jira ticket and notify on Slack" works as a single command.

    "description": (
        "Send an email or reply to an email thread. Use when the user wants to "
        "email someone, reply to an email, or forward an email. "
        "IMPORTANT: Before calling this, use search_cards or search_events to find "
        "the relevant email thread and extract the recipient, subject, and thread_id "
        "from the card/event metadata. Do not guess email addresses."
    ),
    "parameters": {

        },
        "required": ["execute_token"],
    },
}
```

---

## 3. Interaction Patterns

### 3.1 Pattern: Direct Command (Preview -> Confirm -> Execute)

User gives a clear, actionable command. The LLM looks up context, shows a preview,
and executes after confirmation.

```
User: "Approve PR 23 on Bitbucket"

LLM internal steps:
  1. search_cards(query="PR 23 bitbucket", limit=5)
     -> Finds card with PR #23 "Fix payment timeout"
     -> Extracts: workspace="acme", repo="payments", pr_number=23

  2. pr_action(platform="bitbucket", pr_id="acme/payments/23", action="approve")
     -> Egress module returns EgressPreview:
        {
          "status": "preview",
          "summary": "Approve PR #23 'Fix payment timeout' on acme/payments",
          "details": {"pr_title": "Fix payment timeout", "author": "sarah"},
          "warnings": [],
          "execute_token": "egr_abc123..."
        }

LLM response to user:
  "I'll approve **PR #23 'Fix payment timeout'** on acme/payments.
   Author: sarah. Shall I go ahead?"

User: "Yes"

LLM internal steps:
  3. confirm_egress(execute_token="egr_abc123...")
     -> Egress module executes the action
     -> Returns: {success: true, result_url: "https://bitbucket.org/..."}

LLM response:
  "Done! PR #23 approved. [View on Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/...)"
```

### 3.2 Pattern: Smart Resolution (Typo / Fuzzy Match)

User references a ticket/PR that doesn't exist. The LLM searches for close matches
and asks for clarification.

```
User: "Close ticket PAY-89"

LLM internal steps:
  1. search_cards(query="PAY-89")
     -> No results

  2. search_cards(query="PAY jira")
     -> Finds: PAY-98 "Fix payment timeout in checkout"
              PAY-87 "Add retry logic to payment gateway"
              PAY-90 "Payment confirmation email not sent"

  3. LLM notices PAY-89 doesn't exist but PAY-98 is a close match

LLM response:
  "I couldn't find PAY-89. Did you mean one of these?
   - **PAY-98** — Fix payment timeout in checkout
   - **PAY-87** — Add retry logic to payment gateway
   - **PAY-90** — Payment confirmation email not sent"

User: "98"

LLM internal steps:
  4. transition_ticket(platform="jira", ticket_id="PAY-98", target_status="Closed")
     -> Returns preview

LLM: "I'll close **PAY-98 'Fix payment timeout in checkout'**. Confirm?"

User: "Yes"

LLM:
  5. confirm_egress(execute_token="...")
     -> Executed

LLM: "Done! PAY-98 is now Closed."
```

### 3.3 Pattern: Open Compose (User Wants to Write)

User wants to draft/edit a message rather than send something automatically.
The LLM opens the compose editor pre-filled with context.

```
User: "I want to reply to Sarah's email about the nav redesign"

LLM internal steps:
  1. search_cards(query="Sarah nav redesign email")
     -> Finds card_xyz with gmail event

  2. get_card(card_id="card_xyz")
     -> Full card data including:
        - event metadata: {gmail_from: "sarah@co.com", gmail_threadId: "thread_abc"}
        - staged_output: {type: "draft_reply", content: "Hi Sarah, great question..."}
        - subject: "Nav redesign feedback"

  3. open_compose(
       platform="gmail",
       action_type="reply",
       prefill={
         "to": "sarah@co.com",
         "subject": "Re: Nav redesign feedback",
         "thread_id": "thread_abc",
         "body": "Hi Sarah,\n\nGreat question! The nav redesign uses..."
       },
       source_card_id="card_xyz"
     )
     -> WebSocket event sent to UI

LLM response:
  "I've opened a reply to Sarah's email about the nav redesign.
   The editor is pre-filled with a draft based on the card's context.
   Edit it as needed and hit Send when ready."

>> UI: Compose editor slides open with pre-filled data
>> User edits the draft and clicks Send
>> UI calls egress.execute() directly
```

### 3.4 Pattern: Cross-Platform Actions

User wants to perform actions across multiple platforms in one command.

```
User: "The payment bug is fixed. Close PROJ-123 and let Sarah know on Slack"

LLM internal steps:
  1. search_cards(query="PROJ-123")
     -> Finds Jira card for PROJ-123

  2. transition_ticket(platform="jira", ticket_id="PROJ-123", target_status="Done",
                       comment="Fixed — closing ticket.")
     -> Preview returned

  3. search_events(query="Sarah", platform="slack")
     -> Finds Sarah's Slack context, channel #payments

  4. send_slack_message(channel="#payments",
                        message="Hey @sarah — PROJ-123 is now fixed and closed!")
     -> Preview returned

LLM response:
  "I'll do two things:
   1. **Close PROJ-123** on Jira with comment 'Fixed — closing ticket.'
   2. **Send a message** in #payments on Slack: 'Hey @sarah — PROJ-123 is now fixed and closed!'

   Go ahead with both?"

User: "Yes"

LLM:
  5. confirm_egress(execute_token="egr_jira...")   -> Done
  6. confirm_egress(execute_token="egr_slack...")   -> Done

LLM: "Done! PROJ-123 closed on Jira and Sarah notified in #payments."
```

### 3.5 Pattern: Compose New (No Existing Card)

User wants to create something from scratch, not related to an existing notification.

```
User: "Send an email to john@partner.com asking about the Q2 deliverables"

LLM internal steps:
  1. LLM drafts the email content based on context

  2. open_compose(
       platform="gmail",
       action_type="compose",
       prefill={
         "to": "john@partner.com",
         "subject": "Q2 Deliverables Status",
         "body": "Hi John,\n\nHope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base on..."
       }
     )

LLM: "I've opened a new email to john@partner.com with a draft about Q2 deliverables.
      Review and edit the draft, then hit Send."
```

## 4. Preview/Confirm Flow (Technical Details)

### 4.1 How Preview Works

When an egress tool is called, the handler calls `egress.preview()` instead of
`egress.execute()`:

```python
# engine/laya/egress/tool_handlers.py

async def handle_egress_tool(tool_name: str, arguments: dict, space_id: str) -> str:
    """Universal handler for all egress tools (except open_compose and confirm_egress)."""

    # Build EgressRequest from tool arguments
    request = _build_request_from_tool(tool_name, arguments, space_id)

    # Get preview (does NOT execute)
    preview = await egress.preview(request)

    # Register the pending request in laya.egress.pending (in-memory, TTL 300 s,
    # single use). The origin comes from the tool_call_origin contextvar
    # (laya.llm.tools.origin); an untagged caller is treated as "mcp" (fail-closed).
    origin = current_origin()
    entry = pending.create(request, preview, origin)

    if origin == "chat":
        # In-app chat: return the signed token so the LLM can ask the user
        # and then call confirm_egress.
        return json.dumps({
            "status": "preview",
            "summary": preview.summary,
            "details": preview.details,
            "warnings": preview.warnings,
            "estimated_impact": preview.estimated_impact,
            "execute_token": entry.token,   # egr_<nonce>.<sig>
            "instruction": "...",
        })

    # MCP: no token is ever returned. The UI is notified and only the user can
    # resolve it via POST /egress/pending/{request_id}/confirm|reject.
    await _broadcast("egress_confirmation_request", pending.to_public(entry))
    return json.dumps({
        "status": "awaiting_user_confirmation",
        "request_id": entry.request_id,     # egreq_<random>, opaque identifier
        "summary": preview.summary,
        "warnings": preview.warnings,
        "instruction": "...",
    })
```

**Token format.** `egr_<nonce>.<sig>` where `nonce = secrets.token_urlsafe(16)` and
`sig = HMAC-SHA256(secret, nonce|origin)` truncated to 32 hex chars (128 bits).
`secret = secrets.token_bytes(32)` is generated once per engine process, so every
pending action (and token) is dropped on restart — the safe failure mode. Nothing
is persisted; there is no `_pending_requests` dict in `tool_handlers.py` anymore.

### 4.2 How Confirm Works

When the user confirms in the chat, the LLM calls `confirm_egress`:

```python
async def handle_confirm_egress(arguments: dict, space_id: str) -> str:
    """Execute a previously previewed action (in-app chat only)."""
    if current_origin() != "chat":
        return json.dumps({"status": "error", "error": "confirm_egress is only available to the in-app Laya chat. ..."})

    token = arguments.get("execute_token", "")
    try:
        # Signature is verified with hmac.compare_digest BEFORE the store lookup;
        # an entry of another origin is reported as not found and left intact.
        entry = pending.consume_token(token, origin="chat")
    except pending.PendingLookupError as e:
        # reason: invalid_token | not_found | expired — the token is never logged
        return json.dumps({"status": "error", "error": "..."})

    # Shared with POST /egress/pending/{request_id}/confirm: runs egress.execute
    # and audits step="execute" with metadata.source = entry.origin.
    return json.dumps(await execute_pending(entry))
```

`confirm_egress` is a **chat-only** tool (`chat_only_tool_names()` in
`llm/tools/definitions.py`): it never appears in the MCP `list_tools` and MCP
`call_tool("confirm_egress")` is rejected with `METHOD_NOT_FOUND`, regardless of
scopes.

### 4.2.1 MCP-originated actions

An MCP client calling an egress tool receives `awaiting_user_confirmation` +
`request_id`. The UI shows `EgressConfirmModal` (fed by the WS message
`egress_confirmation_request` and by `GET /egress/pending` on reconnect); "Enviar"
calls `POST /egress/pending/{request_id}/confirm` (executes, audits `source="mcp"`)
and "Rejeitar" calls `POST /egress/pending/{request_id}/reject` (audits
`step="egress_rejected"`, nothing executed). Both broadcast
`egress_confirmation_resolved`. See `docs/api-contracts.md`.

### 4.3 How open_compose Works

The `open_compose` tool doesn't go through egress at all — it sends a WebSocket event:

```python
async def handle_open_compose(arguments: dict, space_id: str) -> str:
    """Send a WebSocket event to open the compose editor in the UI."""
    from laya.api.websocket import manager

    await manager.broadcast({
        "type": "open_compose",
        "platform": arguments["platform"],
        "action_type": arguments["action_type"],
        "prefill": arguments["prefill"],
        "source_card_id": arguments.get("source_card_id"),
    })

    platform = arguments["platform"]
    action = arguments["action_type"]
    return json.dumps({
        "status": "compose_opened",
        "message": f"Opened {action} editor for {platform}. User can edit and send from the UI."
    })
```

## 5. Wiring Into the Chat Pipeline

### 5.1 Tool Registration

The egress tools are added to the chat's tool list:

```python
# engine/laya/llm/tools/definitions.py

from laya.egress.tools import get_egress_tool_definitions

def get_all_tool_definitions() -> list[dict]:
    """Return all tool definitions in OpenAI function calling format."""
    return [
        *_read_tools(),
        *_write_tools(),
        *_settings_tools(),
        *get_egress_tool_definitions(),  # <-- NEW
    ]
```

### 5.2 Tool Execution

The egress tool handlers are registered in the executor:

```python
# engine/laya/llm/tools/executor.py

from laya.egress.tool_handlers import (
    handle_egress_tool,
    handle_open_compose,
    handle_confirm_egress,
    EGRESS_TOOL_NAMES,
)

async def execute_tool(name: str, arguments: dict, space_id: str | None = None) -> str:
    # ... existing tool handlers ...

    # Egress tools
    if name == "open_compose":
        return await handle_open_compose(arguments, space_id)
    if name == "confirm_egress":
        return await handle_confirm_egress(arguments, space_id)
    if name in EGRESS_TOOL_NAMES:
        return await handle_egress_tool(name, arguments, space_id)

    return json.dumps({"error": f"Unknown tool: {name}"})
```

### 5.3 MCP Server Extension

The same egress tools are also exposed via the MCP server, so Claude Desktop and other
MCP clients can trigger platform actions through Laya:

```python
# engine/laya/mcp/server.py

from laya.egress.tools import get_egress_tool_definitions

@server.list_tools()
async def list_tools():
    all_tools = get_all_tool_definitions()  # Includes egress tools
    return [convert_to_mcp_format(t) for t in all_tools]
```

## 6. LLM Guidance (System Prompt Additions)

The chat system prompt needs additions to guide the LLM on when and how to use
egress tools:

```
## Platform Actions

You can perform actions on external platforms (email, Jira, GitHub, Bitbucket, Slack)
using the egress tools. Follow these rules:

1. **Always look up context first**: Before calling an egress tool, use search_cards
   or search_events to find the relevant item and extract platform-specific identifiers
   (ticket IDs, thread IDs, PR numbers, email addresses) from the card/event metadata.

2. **Preview before execute**: Egress tools return a preview. Show this to the user
   and ask for confirmation before calling confirm_egress. Never skip confirmation.

3. **Use open_compose for writing**: If the user says "reply to", "draft", "write",
   "respond to", use open_compose to open the editor. If the user gives a clear
   direct command ("approve PR 23", "close PROJ-123"), use the direct action tools.

4. **Smart resolution**: If a ticket/PR ID doesn't match, search for close matches
   and ask the user to clarify. Never guess.

5. **Cross-platform OK**: Users may ask you to do multiple things in one message
   ("close the ticket and notify on Slack"). Handle each as a separate egress action,
   show all previews, then confirm all at once.

6. **Respect limitations**: Only suggest actions for platforms the user has connected.
   If a platform isn't connected, suggest they connect it in Settings > Integrations.
```
